[Esri Global Navigation] is a branded presentation layer for Esri site and account navigation. It provides platform-wide alignment and brand cohesion, allowing visitors to explore new content and products through a familiar and consistent experience

As a centralized microapp, this repo will reduce the duplicated work any given developer needs to implement persistent navigation, while providing a centralized location for distributing rapid updates, new features, and resolving issues with shared ownership.
