# Esri Global Nav (draft)

The Esri Global Nav is the presentation layer for the top-level navigation to be used across Esri's web pages and SAAS applications.

At its core `esri-global-nav` is the HTML and styles (SASS and CSS).  Integrations for frameworks such as [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) would be a great addition and contributions are welcome.
