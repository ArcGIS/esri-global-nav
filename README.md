# Esri Global Nav (draft)

At its core **esri-global-nav** is the presentation layer of the top-level navigation for Esri's web pages and SAAS applications.  It consists of HTML, styles (Sass and CSS), and a little Javascript for light-weight UI interactions.  It should eventually also include framework integrations.

## Using Esri Global Nav
**Phase 1** requires developers to wire HTML and stylesheets as needed.

**Phase 2** will better accommodate build processes by allowing developers to implement the **esri-global-nav** as a framework integration.

## Integrations
Integrations for frameworks such as [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) would be a great addition and contributions are welcome.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome in all forms: issues, pull requests, concepts, inquiries, etc.
